# SHY_deep_learning

- A more cleaned and organized space to consolidate all the code for the deep learning model for Granzyme B for SHY lab.

The goal of this model is to use a deep learning model to identify positive Granzyme B cells, a process usually done manually, to determine the treshold value for positive Granzyme B lympocytes.
